I plan for this project to help me grow and find more
career options. I recently lost my job and so to keep
myself sharp and open up more options I have begun to
take Javascript more seriously. Before this I created
a simple Node.js project, and I plan to integrate these
two projects together to get a better understanding of
full stack development with Javascript as opposed to my
main language C#.

I am following along with Calleb Curry's 12 hour video
about React on Youtube. I use the vdeo as a "lecture"
where I take notes and watch what he's doing, and every
half hour or so of the video I pause and create challenges
based off of whatever was covered in that segment building
on what I made in the last challenge. To see what was
covered check out challenges.md where I keep track of my
challenges.
